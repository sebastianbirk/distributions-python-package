# Python Package: Distributions
This repository contains my distributions python package which has APIs to easily work with Gaussian and Binomial distributions.
More importantly than that, however, it can be used as a tutorial how to build your own Python package.

To install this package using pip, navigate to the folder that contains the repository source files and run

```
pip install .
```

If you have already installed the package but need to make changes and then update the package run

```
pip install --upgrade .
```

To run the unit tests type

```
python -m unittest test
```
